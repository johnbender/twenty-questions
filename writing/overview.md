# Twenty Questions

## Approach

- start with spec
 - possibly empty
 - types
 - inputs
 - debugging context
 - other context

- generate candidates
 - fit spec
 - heuristic approach
 - composition
 - leverage context

- differentiate candidates
 - traces
 - random inputs
 - nominal

- interact with user to further refine candidates
 - add/remove candidates methods
 - alter specs
  - add/remove input
  - add/remove constraints
  - add/remove properties
 - view traces for candidates
 - grep through any of the above

## Examples

- int functions
- python, oath, codehint
- parser
- Hasam's clock
