* Ideas
** Detect and hide irrelevant parts of input.
For example, candidates of the form: (?? . fst) 

Just as we should differentiate candidates by whether or not they fail
on an input, we should differentiate between candidates based on
whether they use a part of the input at all.

** Randomly generated inputs can be unsuitable for presentation.
Want the simplest inputs.  Seems like we'd have better luck with
concolic.  

Ultimately, we could make use of concolic and solver aided. SA could
also help eliminate equivalent candidates.
