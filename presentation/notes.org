* outline
** intro
*** proceed from existing tools
*** build intuition
*** show improvements to existing approaches
*** move beyond simple candidates construction to example based synth
** synthesis
*** cool but limited
**** why
*** problems with synthesis
*** arbitrary candidate (jungloid, sumit gulwani)
*** many candidates (codehint)
** jungloid
*** straight to expression
*** example
**** more can be done to explore options
** codehint
*** manual exploration
**** issues
***** arrive with a single important test case
***** requires a debugger
*** example
**** more can be done to explore options
** tq
*** explicit information about traces
*** other tools for exploration
*** not limited to types as a result
*** manual exploration as last resort
** "spec by example"
*** high level
*** example
**** how this expands on codehint/jungloid not doing enough
**** :auto
**** discuss how a trace might be used to find interesting inputs
*** manual exploration not limited to final expression
**** improvements
***** discovers new and interesting examples
***** summarize differentiation without user intervention
***** orders interesting examples
* examples
** oauth
*** input and output not helpful
*** spec example is url input
